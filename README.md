# Stock-Market-Simulation
With stock market becoming more prevalent in our country such a website is the need of the hour. Inexperienced people need a platform to learn and understand how the stock market works with low risk. The existing websites are too complex to grasp a clear understanding of. So we have designed a stock market simulation  website which is beginner friendly and easy to use for newcomers.

Involvement of money scares many people away from the stock market, our website doesnâ€™t use real currency so newcomers and inexperienced people can have a real time experience of the stock market without any risk. We have implemented real time values into our website to further benefit our users and improve their trading experience. We have used HTML and CSS for the frontend of our website and server-side scripting was done using PHP and MYSQL. The client-side and server-side was integrated using Javascript. The server was hosted using Xampp. The Google Sheets API was used to get realtime values of Stocks.
